            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am <strong>S. Devi Priya</strong>, a B.E. graduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering (2024) with a CGPA of <strong>8.2</strong>. 
                I have completed a certified course in <strong>Java Development</strong> and <strong>Software Testing</strong>, and gained practical 
                experience as a Software Tester at <strong>Amico WIFS Pvt. Ltd</strong>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                During my Java Developer training, I developed CRUD-based projects using <strong>Spring Boot</strong>, tested APIs using <strong>Postman</strong>, 
                and implemented database connectivity. I also have a basic understanding of front-end technologies like 
                <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
            </p>

                I am currently seeking an opportunity in the IT industry to apply my skills and grow professionally.
